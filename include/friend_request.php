<!-- adding some kind of code in the value part.
I'm thinking of something that grabs the username from the url and places it here.active
After the username is attached I can query the post and add the current logged in user and add them to their friends list -->
<form action="friend-profile.php" method="post">
    <button type="submit" value=""></button>
</form>
