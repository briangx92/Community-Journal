# Community-Journal

This is a project that is being done by a group of Software Developers at Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology.

Community Journal is a social media that is kind of different than most kinds of social media's that people know about. This is centered around the idea of it being a blooging social media for actual bloggers.

Most social media is cluttered with stuff most people don't want to read about or don't even care enough to even glance at. This social media will have blogs of whatever a blogger wants to write about. It could be how their day is going to a food blog or a vidio game blog.

You will have many features that are very much needed in this application

1. Friendships with other users
2. Having your own profile
3. Drafting of blogs and of checklists for the users personally ideas
4. And so much more to come

Just wait and see what will be coming next and in a couple months this will be well on its way of being a real social media site for many to use.
